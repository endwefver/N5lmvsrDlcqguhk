(Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1965.) 7.95 dollars; 59s. 6d. DR. ILZA VEITH has essayed a difficult task in choosing hysteria for historical research Hysteria : The History of a Disease is timely, for at present hysteria is a controversial subject between neurologists and psychiatrists. The word itself no longer appears in the Standard Nomenclature of Diseases, and it was eliminated from the Mental Disorders Diagnostic Manual of the American Psychiatric Association in 1952, being replaced by the term 'conversion symptom'. In spite of the long recognition of hysteria, over the centuries, to be a clinical entity, so eminent a psychiatrist as Dr. Eliot Slater in his Shorvon Lecture&bull; holds there is no such disease. Sir Francis Walshe2 in a recent paper, as a neurologist, defends the clinical unity of hysteria. He writes: "Apart from the mimesis of somatic disease hysteria may present, the dramatizations, the exaggerations and the pathological lying are also behavioural disorders, part of the total expression of the abnormal psychical state which is hysteria. A diversity of symptoms from case to case and, in any single case from time to time, no more destroy the unitary quality of the malady than the same diversities destroy that of disseminated sclerosis or of neurosyphilis". It is to be noted that W alshe also &amp;dds: "Nevertheless, Slater's nihilism in regard to hysteria is a challenge to neurologists once again to justify the concept of hysteria as a nosological entity in its own right". Dr. Veith also considers hysteria a disease. The extensive bibliography shows that she has read widely on the subject, and she sets forth much new and interesting information. From early times in Ancient Egypt, hysteria (derived from vcr'l"l;pcx, the Greek word for uterus) was associated with uterine disorders, the symptoms being ascribed to wanderings of that organ. The remedies applied were designed "to cause the womb to go back to its placo". The Hippocratic corpus described hysterwal symptoms, such as the globus hystericus, carefully and also associat.ed the disease with uterine displacements. Aretaeus considered the uterus a migratory organ, but noted that i;he malady also occurred in men. Soranus and Galen poini;ed out the fallacy of uterine migration. In Chapter 3, Dr. Veith emphasizes that St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, regarded hysteria to be due to demoniac possession, induced by magic or witchcraft. For cent uries in the Middle Ages many innocent persons were accused, tortured and executed for witchcraft. William Harvey investigated an accusation of this kind and was more enlightened than Sir Thomas Browne at a later date in that he secured a reprieve for four out of seven of the convicted witches. The sad story of the Salem witches is re-told, whose accusation was supported by so eminent a man as Cotton Mather (1663-1728). Even so late as 1749, a number of nuns were seized with mass hysteria and thought themselves bewitched by a young nun who was condemned and burnt alive in the market-place of Wurzburg. Magic in the Far East is described and is followod by a chapter on hysteria in England. A striking example, which Dr. Veith does not mention, was the case of Queen Elizabeth I. She was subject to 'a spice of the Mother', as hysteria was termed, and, occasionally, had cataleptic seizures. Her malady was most apparent after the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, when she held firmly to the belief that she had not authorized her cousin's execution, but had only signed the death-warrant as a precaution in case of Spanish invasion3 &bull; The medical beliefs about hysteria of later physicians of the past are recounted, including Edward Jorden, Sydenham, Cullen (who returned to the uterine theory), Pinel, Feuchtersleben, Griesingen, R. B. Carter, Jules Fairet, S. Weir Mitchell and Charcot, who studied the malady so bnlliantly at the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris and treated his patients by hypnotism. Babinski, who was chef de cliniq,ue to Charcot, was able to show that hysteria was a nosological entity, although certain of its manifestations could be elicited by suggestion and eliminated by persuasion. W alshe 2 refers to this work, and also to the excellent summary of the psychopathology of hysteria by E. Mapother and A. Lewis&bull;. The book concludes with an account of the work of Janet and J. Breur. Freud was Breur's pupil and the teaching of his chief led him to the evolution of psychoanalysis and the emergence of psychiatry as a specialized branch of medicine. "Knowledge grows from more to more", and, as Dr. Veith mentions on p. 164, even Freud stated that the symptoms in some of his patients were not mentally determined or removable by analysis, but must be regarded as direct consequences of disturbed sexual chemical processes&bull;. Dr. Veith suggests substitution of the term endocrinological for chemical. We know to-day that certain manifestations of mental disease, such as general paralysis of the insane, and cerebral syphilis, are due to infection by the Treponema pal/ida and that forms of encephalitis have a virus causation. Again, powerful psychopathic drugs like those of the phenothiazine group produce effects very similar to those seen as sequelae of encephalitis lethargica. Walshe&bull; observes that mass hysteria epidemics were attributed to witchcraft or demoniacal possession in past centuries, but "it is likely to-day that we should declare them to be due to some unknown and undiscoverable virus and call the condition encephalitis". Research workers, including biochemists, may yet discover an organic basis for hysteria. In the meantime, Dr. Veith's admirable study will help refiexion and, possibly, suggest further methods of approach to the problem. ARTHUR S. MAoNALTY 1 Slater, Eliot, Brit. Med.
